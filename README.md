REST API for Structured Product Catalogue
Developed a RESTful API for a complex product catalogue system using Java, integrated with MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. The Product entity supports detailed attributes such as categories, customizable attributes (size, color, brand), availability status, and user ratings. Implemented CRUD operations, advanced search filters, pagination, and sorting functionalities. Added endpoints for customers to add and remove products from the cart, purchase products, cancel purchases, and manage session handling. Managed API documentation using Swagger and ensured robust error handling by managing all exceptions. The API is fully documented with clear request/response formats and includes setup instructions along with a sample data model.

Key features include:

Product Management: Create, read, update, and delete products with a nested structure.
Cart Operations: Add products to the cart, remove from the cart, and purchase products.
Order History: View past orders and manage order history.
Search & Filter: Search for products with filters for name, category, and attributes.
Pagination & Sorting: Retrieve products with pagination and sorting options.
Rating System: Rate products and update ratings.
